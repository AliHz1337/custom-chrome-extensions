    <h1>About LeakDetect</h1>
    <p>LeakDetect is a browser extension designed to help users identify potential security vulnerabilities on websites they visit. It focuses on detecting exposed .git repositories and .env files, which can inadvertently reveal sensitive information.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>.git Repository Detection:</strong> Scans for publicly accessible .git directories that may expose source code and commit history.</li>
        <li><strong>.env File Detection:</strong> Looks for exposed .env files that may contain sensitive environment variables such as API keys, database credentials, and other configuration details.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Provides an intuitive popup interface for easy access to settings and detected vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Customizable Settings:</strong> Allows users to enable or disable specific detection features based on their needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Once installed, LeakDetect runs in the background while you browse the web. If it detects any vulnerabilities on the current site, it will notify you through the extension's popup interface. You can then review the findings and take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>LeakDetect is committed to user privacy. The extension does not collect or store any personal data or browsing history. All detection processes are performed locally within your browser.</p>
